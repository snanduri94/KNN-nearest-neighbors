# Srikanth Nanduri Data Science Portfolio

Hello World! 

As a lover of sports, IT consultant in Healthcare and Financial Services, human crew member on spaceship earth, and a lover of all things data analytics, it is my pleasure to welcome you into my data science portfolio! The goal of this portfolio is to share my data science trials, errors, insights and everything in between. This portfolio will contain everything from class assignments, group/individual projects, and personal projects that I attempt.

My aim is to continually increase my knowledge but asking questions, searching for data, sharing the results, and engaging in discussions with my peers. With that said, let's get started!

## [Project 1: Data Cleaning and Descriptive Statistic Analysis](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Descriptive%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
1. Analyzed Bank Data containing a mixture of categorical and numerical variables
2. Created dummy variables to generate a sparse matrix for all the categorical variables
3. Normalized all the numerical variables to get a standard unit of measurement

## [Project 2: KNN Doucment Classifier](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Document-Term%20KNN%20Classification%20Analysis_FINAL.ipynb)
1. Developed a KNN Distance Measuring function to calculate the distance between terms in a document against searched queries
2. Calculated distance metrics for Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity
3. Analyzed raw data and computed a document by term matrix that is weighted relative to the number of times the term appears
4. Charted the metrics to compare and contrast between the two calculation methods and the precision of accurately classifying documents

## [Project 3: Census Data Income Classification](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Census%20Data%20Classification.ipynb)
1. Assessed the census data available to appropriately clean and bin variables.
2. Conducted statistical analysis on the various distributions including Workclass versus Income, Education versus Race etc.
3. Modeled three methods to identify the best modeling method to classify the census data: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. 
4. Idenified the Linear Discriminant analysis as the best performing model with an 80.2% accuracy measure.

## [Project 4: Bank PEP Determination Through Classification](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Income%20Classification.ipynb)
1. Utilized KNN Classification and Decision Tree calculator to determine whether an individual is likely to open up dat  
2. Imported functions from SKLEARN library to preprocess and execute the models
