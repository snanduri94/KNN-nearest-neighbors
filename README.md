# Srikanth Nanduri Data Science Portfolio

Hello World! 

As a lover of sports, IT consultant in Healthcare and Financial Services, human crew member on spaceship earth, and a lover of all things data analytics, it is my pleasure to welcome you into my data science portfolio! The goal of this portfolio is to share my data science trials, errors, insights and everything in between. This portfolio will contain everything from class assignments, group/individual projects, and personal projects that I attempt.

My aim is to continually increase my knowledge by asking questions, searching and collecting data, sharing the results, and engaging in discussions with my peers. With that said, let's get started!

## [Project 1: Data Cleaning and Descriptive Statistic Analysis](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Descriptive%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
1. Analyzed Bank Data containing a mixture of categorical and numerical variables
2. Created dummy variables to generate a sparse matrix for all the categorical variables
3. Normalized all the numerical variables to get a standard unit of measurement

## [Project 2: KNN Document Classifier](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Document-Term%20KNN%20Classification%20Analysis_FINAL.ipynb)
1. Developed a KNN Distance Measuring function to calculate the distance between terms in a document against searched queries
2. Calculated distance metrics for Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity
3. Analyzed raw data and computed a document by term matrix that is weighted relative to the number of times the term appears
4. Charted the metrics to compare and contrast between the two calculation methods and the precision of accurately classifying documents

## [Project 3: Census Data Income Classification](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Census%20Data%20Classification.ipynb)
1. Assessed the census data available to appropriately clean and bin variables.
2. Conducted statistical analysis on the various distributions including Workclass versus Income, Education versus Race etc.
3. Modeled three methods to identify the best modeling method to classify the census data: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. 
4. Idenified the Linear Discriminant analysis as the best performing model with an 80.2% accuracy measure.

## [Project 4: Bank PEP Determination Through Classification](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Income%20Classification.ipynb)
1. Utilized KNN Classification and Decision Tree calculator to determine whether an individual is likely to open up dat  
2. Imported functions from SKLEARN library to preprocess and execute the models
3. The Decision Tree and KNN had similar performance measures when reviewing the classification reports

## [Project 5: Cook County Sentencing Data Analysis](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Sentencing%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20and%20Modeling.ipynb)
1. Extracted the Cook County Prison Sentencing Dataset for data preprocessing and exploratory analysis (refer to [link](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/Sentencing%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb) for data cleaning process)
2. Conducted multiple sets of analysis:
  a. Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares, Lasso, and Ridge) to evaluate if the length of the prison sentencing could be accurately predicted.
  b. Cluster Analysis to identify any interrelationships between the data points
  c. Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier function to accurately classify the RACE of the individual commiting the crime
3. Idenified the Decision Tree analysis to be the best classifier function to classify the race of the individual commiting the crime (Random Forest produced the same results)

## [Project 6: NCAA Win Percentage Analysis](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/DSC423_M10_FinalReport_SLAADS.pdf)
(Refer to the executive summary [here](https://github.com/snanduri94/Srikanth_DS_Portfolio/blob/main/M09_ExecutiveSummary.pdf))
1. Aggregated Men's basketball data from the NCAA website for the years between 2015 - 2019
2. Divided the statistics collected into multiple categories to assess the impact of the statistics both individually and in union
3. Utilized feature selection and model evaluation methodology to build the best model to explain the variability in the data
