# Srikanth Nanduri Data Science Portfolio

Hello World! 

As a lover of sports, IT consultant in Healthcare and Financial Services, human crew member on spaceship earth, and a lover of all things data analytics, it is my pleasure to welcome you into my data science portfolio! The goal of this portfolio is to share my data science trials, errors, insights and everything in between. This portfolio will contain everything from class assignments, group/individual projects, and personal projects that I attempt.

My aim is to continually increase my knowledge but asking questions, searching for data, sharing the results, and engaging in discussions with my peers. With that said, let's get started!
